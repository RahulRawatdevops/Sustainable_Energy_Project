Here are the common sources of renewable energy:
#SOLAR ENERGY
- It is the most abudant of all energy resources and can even be harnessed in cloudy weather. The rate at which solar energy is intercepted by the Earth is about 10000 times greater than 
the rate at which humankind consume energy.
Solar energy can deliver heat, cooling, natural lighting, electricty and fues for a host of applications. 
Solar technologies convert sunligt into electrical energy.


#WIND ENERGY 
- Wind energy harnesses the kinetic energy of moving air by using large wind turbines located on land or in sea or freshwater. Wind energy has been used for millennia, but onshore and offshore wind energy technologies
  have evolved over the last few yeras to maximize the electricity produced with taller turbines and larger rotor diameters.

#GEOTHERMAL ENERGY
- Geothermal energy utilize the accessible thermal energy from the earth's interior. Heat is extracted from geothermal reservoirs using wells or other means.
- Reservoirs that are naturally sufficently hot and permeable are called hydrothermal reservoirs, wheras reservoirs that are sufficiently hot but that are improved with hydraulic stimulation are called enhanced geothermal system.

#HYDROPOWER
- Hydropower harnesses the energy of water moving from higher to lower elevation. It can be generated from reservoirs and rivers. Reservoir hydropower plants rely on stored water in a reservoir, while run-of-river hydrpower plans harness energy
  from the avaliable flow of the river.
